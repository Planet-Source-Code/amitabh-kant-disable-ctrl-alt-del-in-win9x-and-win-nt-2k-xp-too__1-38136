### Description

The following code will demonstrate how to disable Ctrl-Alt-del in Win 9x platform, and how to disable various options in the Ctrl-Alt-Del List in Win NT/2K/XP. To understand the code, you must know how to use the Api functions, although I have tried to keep all the api's in seperate classes.

There is also a class which determines if the OS is from Win9x or Win NT series.

Hope you would fine some use for it.
 
### More Info
 
This function uses api calls for disbaling in Win 9x and registry api functions to disable in Win NT/XP/2K.

If you are working in Win NT/2K/XP, it will be safe to create a new user for testing purposes.
